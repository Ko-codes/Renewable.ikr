I've created a comprehensive Renewable Energy Progress Tracker that transforms energy data into an engaging visual journey. The application features a sophisticated time-slider control that lets users explore renewable energy adoption from 2000 to 2024, with smooth D3.js animations bringing the data to life through stacked bar charts and interactive country cards.

The ML forecast engine allows users to set COâ‚‚ reduction targets and explore different growth scenarios, providing realistic projections for future renewable energy adoption. The design uses a modern dark theme with energy-themed colors that create visual hierarchy while maintaining excellent readability across all viewport sizes.
